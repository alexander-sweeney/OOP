# OOP Assignment

This project is about importing data and visualizing it. The dataset I am using is from the online browser game Tribal Wars (www.tribalwars.us). The data will be imported from www.twstats.com, a website that tracks players' progress.

The objective in this game is to conquer (capture) villages from other players. Players work together in tribes and use their troops to battle. My data will represent the villages I have gained in the last month. I will use a number of graphs and chart to accurately visualize the data.
