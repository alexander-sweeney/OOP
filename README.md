# OOP Assignment

This project is about importing data and visualizing it. The dataset I am using is from the online browser game Tribal Wars (www.tribalwars.us). The data will be imported from www.twstats.com which is a website that tracks players' progress.

The objective in this game is to conquer (capture) villages from other players. Players work together in tribes and use their troops to battle. My data will represent villages, ODA (troops killed whilst attacking), and ODD (troops killed whilst defending).

I will gather compare the data of various players and tribes.
